# DAVO Python challenge
In this small test, we're asking you to write a Python script to connect to any publicly available API.  You'll then save these results -- as a log, within a json file, csv, a small front-end table, however you like. Upload this script to an AWS service (again, your choice) and set it to get new results every ten minutes.  Within the script, include tests and catch errors.  Finally, commit your code to Github and send us the link.  

The choice of API, any further manipulation of the data, the AWS service, and means of storing the data are all up to you.  We just want a script on an AWS service that runs continually, gets results every ten minutes, and stores that data somehow.  Creativity here is definitely a plus, but writing good, clean, standardized code is the most important thing.        

### Requirements
  1. Use Python3
  2. Connect to an API
  3. Save these results somehow (log, text file, json, etc.)   
  4. Upload your script to run on your choice of AWS service
  5. Have it run and get results every ten minutes 
  6. Include a small number of tests
  7. Post your code on Github and send us the link
  8. Send us a way to access your AWS service, so we can see the saved data
  

### What you'll send us
  1. Github link
  2. Access to your AWS service
